## Meteoric Expansion

The skies burn with balls of fire barrelling towards the planet at cosmic speeds....Is this the apocalypse?

### Description

Hello, welcome to the mod repository for the Vintage Story mod, Meteoric Expansion!

This mod aims to bring the cosmos to Vintage Story in a very literal sense. In vanilla Vintage Story it's possible to stumble across small surface deposits of meteoric iron...but where did it come from? Meteors don't exist in vanilla!
Meteoric Expansion fills this space. This mod will spawn occasional randomized meteors that will streak through the skies, burning up or exploding like a real meteor would. There's also a small chance that they'll crash to the ground, depositing their riches into the world...!


### IMPORTANT

Meteoric Expansion ships with configurable options! 

By default meteors are NOT destructive and will NOT damage the world or player structures. With the destructive option set to false Meteoric Expansion is purely cosmetic. 
Your world and structures may be safe...but you also won't be able to gather the goodies that a meteorite would deposit. Risk vs reward...  

To change your config, load up a game with the mod installed and enabled. After the mod runs once, a MeteoricExpansionConfig.json file will be available for edit in...
'C:\Users\{Your Username}\AppData\Roaming\VintagestoryData\ModConfig'

Exit to menu, edit this file, then load your save to see the changes!

Further config details can be found by opening the mod ZIP and reading the readme in 'assets\meteoricexpansion\config\'.
